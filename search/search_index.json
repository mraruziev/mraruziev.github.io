Meets surface mount constraint of project <p>Other options: Option 2: OPA333 (TI) op amp Option 3: 1738-SEN0293-ND Option 4: 1027-1030-ND</p> <p>Rationale for choosing 1528-2335-ND : This resistive sensor is very cheap and is compatible with any nanoboard and our board too. It provides straightforward measurement of resistanse changes. We need it for filtering amplification of the signal coming through resistive sensor and this componene texactly does that for low-cost price. If ordered today, its shipping is expected in 5 days.</p> </li> <li> <p>MCP6004-I/P-ND op-amp</p> <p></p> <ul> <li>$0.40/each or free</li> <li>Link to product</li> </ul> Pros Cons Low-power Varying performance with the temperature change quad rail-to-rail I/O CMOS Limited slew rate Low power consumption </li> </ol> <p>Choice: Option 2: OPA333 (TI) op amp</p> <p>Rationale for choosing MCP6004: The opamp MCP6004 is given by Microchip and offers low power consumption and has good compatibility with the nano board I am using for the subsystem, which also belongs to Microchip. It is very low cost and there is no need for the level-shifting of the componenets if this componenet is choosen. It's shipping speed is not fast but it is given in our kit so we can easily access it.</p>"},{"location":"02-Component-Selection/Component-Selection/#block-connectors-sensor-input-subsystem-headers","title":"Block: Connectors (sensor input + subsystem headers)","text":"Solution Photo Cost Link Pros Cons Option 1: JST-XH (2.5 mm pitch) wire-to-board Low JST XH datasheet \u2022 Locking friction \u2022 ~3 A (AWG22) \u2022 Widely available \u2022 Not breadboard-friendly Option 2: Molex/JST-XH assortment kit \\(20\u2013\\)30 Adafruit JST-XH kit (PDF) \u2022 Handy assortment for lab builds \u2022 Bulk purchase; storage overhead Option 3: 0.1\u2033 (2.54 mm) pin headers + housings Very low Adafruit 0.1\u2033 break-away header \u2022 Breadboard-compatible \u2022 Lowest cost \u2022 No latch; can pull loose <p>Choice: JST-XH JST-XH on the PCB for field connections; 0.1\u2033 headers for bench adapters.</p> <p>Rationale: XH gives retention and current capacity on-device; 0.1\u2033 is convenient during prototyping.</p>"},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/","title":"Bill of Materials","text":"","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>written context</p>","tags":["tag1","tag2"]},{"location":"03-BOM/BOM/#bill-of-materials-example-as-table","title":"Bill of Materials Example (as Table)","text":"<p>Table ##: An example of one approach to adding your BOM table to this section.</p> Part Name/Description Qty Unit Cost Total Cost Manufacture Manufacturer # Vendor Link Datasheet Link Schematic Reference Designators 8-bit SIPO/SISO Shift Register, SOIC-16 package 1 $0.49 $ 0.49 NXP 74HC595D,112 DigiKey datasheet link U1 0.1 \u00b5F Ceramic Capacitor, +/-10%, X7R, 50V, 0805 package 10 0.2750 $2.75 KEMET C0805F104K5RACTU PRLTA 109 n/a C2, C4, C6, C7, C8, C9, C10, C11, C12, C16 <p>Note: Setting it up as a table is nice because it is completely viewable without scaling issues.
