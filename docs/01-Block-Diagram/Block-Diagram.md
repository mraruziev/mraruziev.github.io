## Overview
Purpose fo block diagram is to ensure that my subsystem is going to be connected properly to subsystem of my teammates and the project will run properly. The sensor I will be working on is resistive sensor for the project. Button and LED will be helping me to make required actions from the measurements the sensor will give. Team connections are be shown more in the team block diagram.This shows a person a reasonable outline about why a part was chosen based on power levels. A block diagram also helps with our team project, which shows you where each board will be connected with the other team members.
