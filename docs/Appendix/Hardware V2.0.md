# Version 2.0 Hardware Improvements  
### Asadbek Ruziev — Resistive Conductivity Subsystem (VibeWater)

Version 2.0 redesign of my hardware subsystem. These changes improve my board and whole subsystem.

---

## 1. Larger PCB Size (From 7–8 cm to 10 × 10 cm)
The original PCB was compact and difficult to route cleanly. Increasing the size to 10 × 10 cm would:
- Provide better separation of analog and digital sections  
- Allow cleaner routing with less electrical noise  
A larger board results in more stable readings and better long-term reliability.


## 2. Chaning my sensor
Since my resistive sensor was not accurate, having different sensor would help me make better measurements. 

## 3. Rechecking my PCB before sending to Peralta or JLC
Since I encountered many issues with my PCB after it was printed, I would want to make PCB perfect before submitting it. Now as changes applied my hardware would have been improved very well.

## 4. Changing locations of footprints.
Since my footprints were not very perfectly aligned, I would make sure that spots are in better place so that I will be able to make better conenction. For instance, my PIC could have been aligned in the bottom and sensor is on top side.
