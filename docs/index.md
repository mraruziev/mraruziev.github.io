## Introduction

* Introducing VibeWater - a new era in the water quality. In this project, our team aims to build cheap system for monitoring water quality, specifically for individuals and communities, where pollution levels are high and access to monitoring system is very limitied. 

### Project Summary

* My part of the subsystem for this project is about<ins>checking conductivity in the water for the safety of water through the coper probe. </ins> There is going to be real-time feedback through visual alerts like LEDs. There are going to be many parts of projects that I will be sharing through this website. Stay tuned to see more from my individual contribution for team projects for EGR 304.
* For more information on how we integrate pH sensors, opacity sensors and measure for air contamination, water safety parameters, please check our [team report.](https://egr304-2025-f-210.github.io/)


### My Contribution

* Working on schematic, block diagram and software proposal, coding the subsystem of zinc probe for measuring resistivity, conductivity
* User needs and benchmarking
* Design Ideation
* Sending data to the Neel's board - main board
